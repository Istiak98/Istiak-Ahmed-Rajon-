          React JS and React Native are two quite popular tools that are
          utilized for programming a multitude of applications and websites.
          What’s more interesting that each of their unique features is their
          unknown history. Facebook, in the year 2011, realized that they need a
          newer model with an advanced user interface to cater to the growing
          demands of the application. Constant updates and developments required
          the realignment of the entire application which is why, Jordon Walke,
          an engineer at Facebook, came up with the prototype for React JS.
          What’s more? This innovation had turned out to be a game-changer for
          the company. Later on in the year 2015, they came out with React
          Native which built an impressive groundwork towards developing
          applications, for both smartphones and websites. It’s alright to have
          your doubts when it comes to picking either one of them. In case you
          are unable to conclude which one is better than the two, this article
          is just for you. We have included crucial features of both, React
          Native and React JS, which will assist you in decrypting the
          differences, and distinguishing between React JS and React Native
          accordingly. Before we proceed with differentiating between the two,
          let us first understand what’s React JS and React Native.

          React JS is an open-source JavaScript library that is used to build
          user interfaces for applications, specifically for the web. You can
          use a feature called ‘components’ which is a small part of a code in
          order to compose complex user interfaces. React JS mainly incorporates
          two segments: One of them is components which include pieces of HTML
          code that are visible in your user interfaces and the other segment is
          the HTML document where the rendering process of the components that
          you use will take place.

        <h1 className="fw-bold text-start">An overview of React Native</h1>
        <p className="text-start">
          React Native, which came after React JS, is an open-source JavaScript
          framework. Developers use React Native to develop mobile and web
          applications, suited for iOS, Android as well as Windows. It focuses
          on developing cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript
          only. React Native and React JS are quite similar in this manner but
          React Native makes use of native components as its building blocks.
          Moreover, React Native is best suited for mobiles rather than the web.

                <p className="text-start">
                  In computer programming, Create, Read, Update, and Delete
                  (CRUD) are the four basic functions of persistent storage.
                  Alternative terms may be used to define the four basic
                  functions of CRUD. Get instead of read, change instead of
                  update, or discard instead of delete. CRUD may also be used to
                  describe user interface rules that make it easier to view,
                  retrieve, and modify information. Often uses computerized
                  forms and reports. This term was probably first introduced by
                  James Martin in his 1983 book, Managing Database Environments.
                  You can extend the acronym to CRUDL to cover the listing of
                  large datasets that add complexity such as: B. Pagination when
                  the record is too large to be easily saved in memory. CRUD is
                  an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the
                  four most basic operations that can be performed on most
                  traditional database systems and form the backbone for
                  interacting with any database

                  <h5 className="fs-1 fw-bold">Create</h5>
                  <p>
                    The first character of CRUD, `C`, refers to CREATE, also
                    known as add, insert. This operation expects a new record to
                    be inserted using the SQL insert statement. SQL uses the
                    INSERT INTO statement to create a new record in the table.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h5 className="fs-1 fw-bold">Read</h5>
                  <p>
                    The second character in CRUD, `R`, indicates a SELECT
                    operation. The word "read" retrieves data or recordsets from
                    one or more of the listed tables. SQL uses a SELECT
                    statement to retrieve the data. You can use SQL Server
                    Management Studio, SQL Server Data Tools, or sqlcmd to run
                    queries as needed.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h5 className="fs-1 fw-bold">Update</h5>
                  <p>
                    The third character in CRUD, `U`, indicates the update
                    process. When you use the keyword Update, SQL makes changes
                    to one or more existing data records in the table. When you
                    perform an update, you need to define the target tables and
                    columns that need to be updated, and their values. You may
                    also need to know which row needs to be updated. In general,
                    you should limit the number of rows to avoid lock escalation
                    and parallelism issues.
                  </p>
                  <h5 className="fs-1 fw-bold">Delete</h5>
                  <p>
                    The last character in a CRUD operation is "D", which means
                    to delete a record from the table. SQL uses the SQLDELETE
                    command to delete a record from a table
                  </p>

                <p className="text-start">
                  So far, I've talked a lot about CRUD operations. It is known
                  as the basis for SQL operations in all database products. I
                  also explained how to implement CRUD operations in SQL Server.
                  We encourage you to read the articles about SQL Insert, SQL
                  Delete, and SQL Update that are part of the CRUD operation.
                  Implementing create, update, delete, and insert operations is
                  relatively easy because they are very similar operations. The
                  most efficient way to implement CRUD operations in SQL is to
                  use stored procedures. For more information, see the article
                  Creating and using CRUD stored procedures.
